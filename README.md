# LeetCode-Solutions-in-Java
 1. LeetCode 143: Reorder List
 Problem Statement: Given the head of a singly linked list, reorder the list to follow the pattern: first node,
 last node, second node, second last node, and so on.
2. LeetCode 287: Find the Duplicate Number
 Problem Statement: Given an array `nums` containing `n + 1` integers where each integer is between `1`
 and `n` (inclusive), and there is only one repeated number, return this repeated number. You must solve
 the problem without modifying the array and using only constant extra space.
3. LeetCode 24: Swap Nodes in Pairs
 Problem Statement: Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.
 4. LeetCode 82: Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II
 Problem Statement: Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers,
 leaving only distinct numbers from the original list.
 5. LeetCode 456: 132 Pattern
 Problem Statement: Given an array of `n` integers `nums`, a 132 pattern is a subsequence of three
 integers `nums[i]`, `nums[j]`, and `nums[k]` such that `i < j < k` and `nums[i] < nums[k] < nums[j]`.
 Return `true` if there is a 132 pattern in `nums`, otherwise, return `false`.
 6. LeetCode 84: Largest Rectangle in Histogram
 Problem Statement: Given an array of integers `heights` representing the histogram's bar heights where
 the width of each bar is 1, return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.
